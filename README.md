# Stock-Price-Visualization

As part of JPMorgan Chase & Co's prestigious 'Software Engineering Virtual Internship', I was given the opportunity to experience life as a software engineer at the company. With context to investment banking, I dealt with a hypothetical request from the trading department to produce this application. I was able to complete a series of client-based modules in the development of this tool, in order to monitor and more effiecntly interpret the proce of a sample stock.

In doing so, I handled integration of server-side requests, and delivered client-side data by producing charts and dashboards through use of JPMorgan's open-source 'Perspective' framework. I was able to implement unit tests for purposes of ensuring clean and effective code, successfully addressing possible edge cases of an increasing or decreasing rate of change. The end product serves as an open-source resource for potential traders, providing them with a user-friendly visual interpretation of price fluctuation.
